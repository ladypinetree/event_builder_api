### About the application:
Event Builder is a multi phase app that will feature 4 additional versions rolled out over the next several weeks. The application aims to help event owners keep track of due dates and contacts for planning items, while allowing them to share their event information with guests. The current application was built using a rails API with the goal of familiarizing the developer with Ember and the ideals of scalable feature based development.

### Technology I Used for Event Builder:
- Rails
- Bootstrap
- Ember
- Sass
- Handlebars

### Routes I used
```
this.route('sign-up');
this.route('sign-in');
this.route('change-password');
this.route('users');
this.route('events');
this.route('not-found', { path: '/*wildcard' });
this.route('event', { path: '/events/:event_id' });
this.route('new');
this.route('edit', { path: '/events/:event_id/edit' });
```

### To build my site I used:
- I used rails to build an API.
- We created an API using 2 related models, one is the User, the other is Events
- The User can:
- Create an event.
- Index their events.
- Update their event.
- Delete their event.
- View their single event.

### Some of the technical hurdles I solved:

- Getting the delete button for the index to return the correct event.
- Managing urls that did not exist.
- Managing guests accessing restricted URLs.
- Inputting the date into the event form.
- Glyphicons in my buttons.
- Cancel buttons
- Clearing forms
